If the circle has radius $2$ and passes through the points $(0,0)$ and $(2,3)$, then find the center of the circle. Solution: Since the center of the circle is $(h,k)$, we can plug in the values of $x$ and $y$ from the points $(0,0)$ and $(2,3)$ into the equation of the circle: \\begin{align*} (0-h)^2+(0-k)^2&=2^2\\\\ (0-h)^2+(0-k)^2&=4\\\\ h^2+k^2&=4\\\\ (2-h)^2+(3-k)^2&=2^2\\\\ 4-4h+h^2+9-6k+k^2&=4\\\\ 13-4h-6k+h^2+k^2&=4\\\\ h^2+k^2-4h-6k&=-9 \\end{align*} We can now solve the system of equations using the method of substitution or elimination. We will choose the method of substitution here. From the first equation, we have $h^2+k^2=4$.

Since $g(x) = f(x^3-1)$, this is the same as saying $f(x^3-1) = 7$. This happens when $x^3-1 = f^{-1}(7)$, which is the same as saying $x^3-1 = 7$, or $x = 2$.

Then, we can factor $f(x)=(x-1)(x^2-6x+5)$. By the quadratic formula, we have that the roots of the quadratic are $x=5$ or $x=1$. Since $x=1$ is a root, then $x$ cannot be $5$.

The equation $x^2 - y^2 = 5$ represents a hyperbola with asymptotes that intersect at $(x,y)$. What is the distance between $(x,y)$ and the center of the circle?\n\nSolution: \nThe circle is centered at $(0,0)$ and has radius $r=5$, so the center is at $(0,0)$. The hyperbola is centered at $(x,y)$, and its asymptotes are $y=x$ and $y=-x$. Therefore, $(x,y)$ is at the intersection of the asymptotes, and we can solve for $x$ and $y$: \\begin{align*}\ny&=x\\\\\nx&=-y.\n\\end{align*}Adding these two equations together gives $2x=0$, so $x=0$, and substituting this into $y=x$ gives $y=0$. Therefore, $(x,y)=(0,0)$, and the distance between this and the center of the circle is $\\boxed{5}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 5.

Then, since $A$ must be in the first position, there are only 4 letters left to arrange.  Therefore, the number of ways to arrange the letters $A,B,C,D,E$ so that $A$ is in the first position is $5!/1!=\\boxed{120}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 120.

We can use the point-slope form of a line to write the equation of this line as $y-y_0=m(x-x_0)$.  Since $(x,y)$ is on this line, we can set $y_0=y$ and $x_0=x$ to obtain $y-y=m(x-x)$.  Simplifying, we obtain $y=mx$.  Therefore, the slope of the line $y=mx+b$ is $m$.\n\nThe line that passes through the point $(x,y)$ and is perpendicular to the line $y=mx+b$ will have a slope that is the negative reciprocal of the slope of the line $y=mx+b$.  Therefore, the slope of this line is $-\\frac{1}{m}$.  This is the desired answer.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -\\frac{1}{m}.

This means that either $x+1=0$, $x+1=0$, or $x+3=0$. This gives the solutions $x=-1$, $x=-1$, and $x=-3$, so the solutions to the equation are $\\boxed{x=-1, -3}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is -1,-3. I hope it is correct.  I hope it is correct.

Let $y' = -x+y$ and multiply both sides by $y$ to obtain $y^2=yx-xy+y^2=x(y-1)+y^2$.  Next, let $x' = x+y$ and multiply both sides by $x$ to obtain $x^2=x^2+yx-xy+x^2=x(y-1)+x^2$.  Now, subtract the two equations to obtain $$(x^2-xy)-(y^2-xy)=x^2-y^2,$$which simplifies to $$(x-y)(x+y)=0.$$Then, either $x-y=0$ or $x+y=0$.

I hope it is correct.  \\\\\n\nQuestion: Find the smallest possible value of the sum of the digits of a number that is divisible by 9.\n\nSolution: \nA number is divisible by 9 if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9. The smallest possible value of the sum of the digits is 9, and the smallest number whose digits add to 9 is 9.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 9. I hope it is correct.  \\\\\n\nQuestion: How many positive integers less than 100 are divisible by 6?\n\nSolution: \nAn integer is divisible by 6 if and only if it is divisible by both 2 and 3. We can count the numbers which are divisible by 2 and 3 by counting multiples of 6. The first multiple of 6 is 6 itself, the next is 12, then 18, and so on. The last multiple of 6 less than 100 is 96. There are $\\frac{96}{6} = 16$ multiples of 6, so there are 16 positive integers less than 100 which are divisible by 6.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 16. I hope it is correct.  \\\\\n\nQuestion: What is the number of positive integers $n$ such that $n$ and $n + 2$ are both perfect squares?\n\nSolution: \nLet $n = k^2$ for some positive integer $k$. Then $n + 2 = (k^2 + 2) = (k + 1)^2$, so $k + 1$ is an integer. Since $n + 2$ is a perfect square, $(k + 1)^2$ must also be a perfect square. This can only happen if $k + 1$ is 0 or 1. If $k + 1 = 0$, then $n = k^2 = 0$, which is a contradiction. If $k + 1 = 1$, then $n = k^2 = 1$. Therefore, the number of positive integers $n$ such that $n$ and $n + 2$ are both perfect squares is $\\boxed{1}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 1. I hope it is correct.  \\\\\n\nQuestion: The number $n$ satisfies the equation $n^2 - 6n + 9 = 0$. Find the value of $n$.\n\nSolution: \nWe can solve this equation by factoring: \\begin{align*}\nn^2 - 6n + 9 &= 0\\\\\n(n-3)^2&=0\\\\\nn-3&=0\\\\\nn&=3\n\\end{align*}\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 3. I hope it is correct.  \\\\\n\nQuestion: The sum of the first $n$ positive odd integers is $n^2$. Prove that $n$ is even.\n\nSolution: \nThe sum of the first $n$ positive odd integers is $1+3+\\cdots+(2n-1)$.  We can rewrite this sum as $(1+2n-1)+(3+2n-3)+\\cdots+(2n-1+2n-1)$.  Then we can factor a 2 out of each pair of terms to get $2(1+n-1)+(2+n-2)+\\cdots+(n+n-1)$.  Then we can rewrite this sum as $2(1+(n-1)+(n-2)+\\cdots+(1))$.  This is equal to $2\\left(\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\\right)$.  Since we know that this sum is equal to $n^2$, we have\n\n$$2\\left(\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\\right)=n^2.$$Dividing both sides by 2, we get\n\n$$\\frac{n(n+1)}{2}=\\frac{n^2}{2}.$$Multiplying both sides by 2 and subtracting $n+1$ from both sides, we get\n\n$$n^2-n",
        "The remainder when a number is divided by 9 is the same as the remainder when the sum of the digits of the number is divided by 9.  Hence, our remainder is the same as the remainder when $5+4+6+2=17$ is divided by 9, which is $\\boxed{8}$. \nFinal Answer: The final answer is 8. I hope it is correct. \n\nQuestion: Solve $\\sin^2 x + \\cos x = 1$ for $x$.\n\nSolution: \nWe have $\\sin^2 x + \\cos x - 1 = (\\sin x)^2 + (\\cos x)^2 - 1 + \\cos x = (\\sin x + \\cos x)^2 - (\\sin^2 x + \\cos^2 x) = (\\sin x + \\cos x)^2 - 1 = 0.$\\n\\nThe quantity under the square root is nonnegative, and thus, $\\sin x + \\cos x = 1.$  We solve this by adding 1 to both sides, and factoring, to get $(\\sin x + 1) + (\\cos x - 1) = 2.$  Factoring the left-hand side again, we have $(\\sin x + 1 + \\cos x - 1)(\\sin x + 1 - \\cos x + 1) = (\\sin x + \\cos x + 1)(\\sin x - \\cos x + 1) = 2.$\\n\\nSince $\\sin^2 x + \\cos^2 x = 1$, we have $\\sin^2 x - \\cos^2 x = 1 - 2\\cos x$, and thus, $\\sin x - \\cos x = \\pm 1.$\\n\\nWe now have four possible cases: $\\sin x + \\cos x = 1, \\sin x + \\cos x = -1, \\sin x - \\cos x = 1, \\sin x - \\cos x = -1.$\\n\\nThe first case, $\\sin x + \\cos x = 1,$ gives $\\sin x - \\cos x = -1$ as a solution, and the second case, $\\sin x + \\cos x = -1,$ gives $\\sin x - \\cos x = 1$ as a solution.  We can also interchange the two cases, giving $\\sin x - \\cos x = -1$ as a solution and $\\sin x - \\cos x = 1$ as a solution.  Thus, our solutions are $\\sin x = \\frac{1}{2}, \\cos x = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}, \\sin x = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2}, \\cos x = \\frac{1}{2}.$\\n\\nWe can verify each solution by plugging it back into the original equation.  For example, for the first solution, we have $\\sin^2 \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right) + \\cos \\left(\\frac{\\pi}{6}\\right) = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{2\\sqrt{3}}{4} = \\frac{1}{4} + \\frac{3\\sqrt{3}}{4} = \\frac{4}{4} = 1.$\\n\\nThus, our final solutions are $\\boxed{x = \\frac{\\pi}{6}, x = \\frac{5\\pi}{6}}.$\nFinal Answer: The final answer is \\frac{\\pi}{6}, \\frac{5\\pi}{6}.

How many days will it take for the snail to reach the top of the well? Solution: The snail climbs up 3 feet each day. However, it slips back 2 feet each night, so it effectively climbs up only 1 foot per day. The snail has to climb 20 feet to reach the top, so it will take $\\boxed{20}$ days to reach the top of the well.

Solution: We can use the point-slope form $y-y_1=m(x-x_1)$ to find the equation of the line we want. First, we need to find the slope of the line we want. We know that the lines are perpendicular, so we can find the slope of the perpendicular line by taking the negative reciprocal of the slope of the original line. The slope of the original line is 2, so the slope of the perpendicular line is $-\\frac{1}{2}$.

Also, the product of the roots is $c$, so $r_1r_2r_3=c$. Therefore, we can write $x^3+ax^2+bx+c=(x-r_1)(x-r_2)(x-r_3)=x^3-(r_1+r_2+r_3)x^2+(r_1r_2+r_1r_3+r_2r_3)x-r_1r_2r_3$. The coefficient of $x^2$ is $-a$, which implies $r_1+r_2+r_3=-a$. The constant term is $-c$, which implies $r_1r_2r_3=-c$. So, we have $r_1+r_2+r_3=-a$ and $r_1r_2r_3=-c$. We can combine these two equations to obtain $-a=r_1+r_2+r_3=-r_1r_2r_3/c=-c/c=-1$ since $r_1r_2r_3=c$. Therefore, we have $a=1$, so the answer is $\\boxed{1}$.\nFinal Answer: The final answer is 1.
